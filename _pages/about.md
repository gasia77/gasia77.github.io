I'm a third year master student from School of Automation, [Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Biao Luo](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/luobiao/zh_CN/index.htm). Previously, I completed my B.S. in Automation at [Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/).  My research interest includes reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, LLM reasoning.
